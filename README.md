# Covid-CA

Welcome to COVID California! Are you a local California resident? Or planning to travel to California and want information regarding COVID in the county you will be staying? Hopefully you're staying safe and feeling healthy; and if not, we will help you find a testing facility near you as well as give you up to date cumulative statistics within any California County.

## Description 

COVID-California is a web application that receives the user’s input of a county in California. After the user's input is received, the web application will display up-to-date statistics of covid cases and covid deaths in that relevant county. Along with a chart displaying the cumulative recorded data since March 18th of the year 2020. In the middle of the page, there are local COVID-19 testing facilities that the user can click on to be redirected and get directions to using google maps. If none of those facilities are close enough you can click the link below and be redirected to a new page which will list more facilities within that California County. At the bottom of the page there is information regarding COVID-19 and symptoms that individuals should look out for. 

## Process

### Motivation 

We found that there is an overwhelming amount of information and data related to COVID on the Internet - when you search covid cases, you often get outdated cases from before the summer, or information by country. It can take a lot of Googling to finally find EXACTLY what you want - like cases in your county ...or testing facilities in your county, that aren’t cluttered or a giant list to sort through.  We thought, wouldn’t it be nice to have a site/app that just gives you the numbers and testing facilities in a straightforward way?  And Covid CA was born.

### Collaborators 
This was a group effort between Aaron Centeno, Laquesha Nance, and Suzanna Akins.  Aaron handled most of the design and responsiveness, while Laquesha and Suzanna focused on using Javascript and jQuery to create function calls and dynamically create elements on the page.

### Technologies Used 
* GitHub
* Zoom
* CSS
* HTML
* Photoshop
* JavaScript
* Jquery
* Materialize
* Slack
* Chart.js
* Server Side API's


### Overall Process

Our planning process was fun.  Aaron created these sketches so we could have a visual idea and understanding of what we wanted our product to look like: ![Image of Plan Sketches](./assets/images/sketches.png).

After the HTML and CSS were laid out Laquesha and Suzanna began to create elements dynamically using JavaScript and JQuery. Together we worked out multiple bugs within the application.
